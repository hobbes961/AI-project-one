#part4 Hill Climbing with random restarts

#2 inputs:
#number of times you start hill climbing
#number of iterations each hill climb gets
#the product of these 2 numbers will be equal to the number used in 3

#compare output with part 3

#display:
#vizualize final optimized puzzle
#eval
#time
#plot thingfrom #3
#evaluating effect of different number of restarts select on that works best
#for this problem


#what we need
#2 user inputs
#hill climbing which we already sorta have
#randomly restarting, need a save of original grid 
#then outputs I guess?
